                As a kid growing up, I had a great fascination with video games (and I still do). This fascination was my gateway into the world of computers and coding.<br /><br />
                Even though I am not a video game developer, I realized my dream by becoming an <span className="text-white underline underline-offset-3">IT engineer</span>, followed by a <span className="text-white underline underline-offset-3">master&apos;s degree</span> in computer science, finishing off by becoming a <span className="text-white underline underline-offset-3">PhD</span> in CS and mathematics.<br /><br />
                My journey through the realm of CS was <span className="text-white underline underline-offset-3">long and fulfilling</span>. It started by building smaller projects that grew in size with each passing year, continued by a <span className="text-white underline underline-offset-3">deep dive into AI</span>, and lately, <span className="text-white underline underline-offset-3">full-stack development</span>.<br /><br />
                During those years, I had experience <span className="text-white underline underline-offset-3">teaching JavaScript, Python, DSA, and AI</span>, at my local university, <span className="text-white underline underline-offset-3">working on various different projects</span> from machine learning, to full-stack and mobile app development, <span className="text-white underline underline-offset-3">teaching English</span>, working with <span className="text-white underline underline-offset-3">text translation</span> and <span className="text-white underline underline-offset-3">writing scientific articles</span> for HAC journals.
